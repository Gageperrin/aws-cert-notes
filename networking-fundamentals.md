7. Application

Media layers are 1-3, while host layers are 4-7.

## 1 - Physical

Physical medium can be a copper wire (electrical), fibre (light), or WIFI (RF).

Layer 1 specfications define the transmission and reception of **raw bit streams** between a device and a shared physical medium. It define things like voltage levels, timing, rates, distances, modulation, and connectors.

A networking device called a hub can connect multiple devices. Anything received on any port is transmitted on every other port, including errors and collisions.

No device addressing, all data is processed by all devices. If multiple devices transmit at once, then a collision occurs. There are no media access control and no collision detection at this layer. Layer 1, in effect, scales very poorly.


## 2 - Data Link

Devices at this layer have a unique hardware address (MAC address). It is 46 bits in hexidecimal, 24 bits for manufacturer. Frames are generated by the source device, and they can be addressed to a destination or broadcast.

Data link frame: Preamble of 56 bits & SFD 8 bits - Destination MAC address - Source MAC address - ET 16 bits - Payload (46-1500 bytes) -> FCS 32 bits.

Preamble -> MAC Header -> Payload

The payload is the data the frame carries from source to destination. It is generally provided by layer 3, and the EtherType (ET) attribute defines which Layer 3 protocol is used.

Layer 2 solves Layer 1 collision problems by controlling access to the physical medium through CSMA/CD. Process:
(1) Source device creates a Frame intending to send data to destination device.
(2) Source device checks carrier.
(3) If no carrier, then layer 1 takes the frame data, converts it to physical standard and transmits.
(4) Layer 1 on the destination device receives and passes frame to Layer 2 destination device.
(5) If destination device needs to send data, it builds a frame
(6) It detects a carrier, so it waits before transmitting.
(7) Once the first frame is finishing transmitting, it transmits the second frame.
(8) If collisions are detected (CD) both back off for a time and re-tried at a random time. Keeps re-trying with increased backup time if further collisions occur.

Layer 2 using a HUB is a weak solution because of collision and errors. It is better to use a Switch.

Switches understand frames and MAC addresses. They maintain a MAC address table which starts off as empty. As the switch received frames on its ports, it learns the connected devices and populates the MAC address table.

Switches store and forward frames. This means only valid frames are forwarded. Collisions are isolated on the port they occur. Every X port has X collision domains. It allows switches to scale.


## 3 - Network

Two Local Area Networks need to be connected over a large distance. Layer 2 will not suffice for this communication. Ethernet is a Layer 2 protocol. Long distance point to point links will use more suitable protocols such as PPP/MPLS/ATM.

Internet Protocol (IP) is a Layer 3 protocol which adds cross-network IP addressing and routing to move data between Local Area Networks without direct P2P links. IP packets are moved step by step from source to destination via intermediate networks. Encapsulated in different frames along the way. Router devices (L3) remove frame encapsulation and add new frame encapsulation at every hop.

### IPv4

Source IP address and destination IP address included as well as Layer 4 protocol values.

### IPv6

Similar to IPv6 packets with bigger source and destination IP addresses.
