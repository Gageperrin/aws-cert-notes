# AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate Notes

These are my notes for the AWS SOA-C01 exam. I have taken the content from [Adrian Cantrill's course](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate) for this exam, Tutorial Dojo's practice tests, and the official AWS documentation. 

These notes assume full and prior knowledge of requisite material for the Solutions Architect Associate exam and will not mention or cover any topics that are featured in that exam.
