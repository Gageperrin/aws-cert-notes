# M312 Diagnostics and Debugging

These are my notes from the official MongoDB course M312 Diagnostics and Debugging which can be found for free [here](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M312/about).

## Chapter 1: Introduction

The course will cover various diagnostic and debugging tools while providing some common real-world troubleshooting scenarios as a heuristic for understnading the debugging process.

## Chapter 2: Tooling Overview

* `mongostat` - shows incoming operations.
* `mongotop` - shows collections being read from and written to.
* `mongoreplay` - replay and record network traffic.
* `mongo` - the shell.
