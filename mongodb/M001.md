# MongoDB M001 Course

## Chapter 1: What Is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data as documents which are in turn stored as collections.

A document is a way to organize and store data as a set of field-value pairs. Documents are grouped together into collections, and a database often contains multiple document collections.

MongoDB Atlas is the cloud solution for MongoDB storage. It is a database as a service.

Atlas users can deploy clusters where each server is configured as a replica set. A replica set consists of a few connected machines that stroe the same data to ensure that if something happens to one of the machines then the data will remian intact. An instance is a single machine on-premise on in the cloud running the MongoDB database software.

Atlas can manage cluster creation, run and maintain database deployment, use a cloud service prvoider of choice, and be used for experimenting with new tools and features. Atlas has a free tier that includes one free cluster with a 3-server replica set and 512 MB storage. It never expires. The free tier also includes charts, Realm, and is suitable for small-scale apps.

## Chapter 2: Importing, Exporting, and Querying Data

MongoDB stores data in BSON, but Users work with MongoDB documents in JSON. BSON is a binary encoded format for machines that offers a larger range of data support than JSON does.

To import and export in JSON run `mongoimport` and `mongoexport` and for BSON run `mongorestore` and `mongodump`. These take the `--uri` argument for the Uniform Resource Identifier. BSON takes a serv for its URI string to establish a secure connection.

Data explorer can provide an accessible view of collections and documents in a database in the UI. A namespace is the concatenation of the database name and collection. Queries must be valid JSON.

To query through the command line, first connect to the database (`connect(url, user,password)` and verify the connection to the right cluster with `show dbs`. To run a query, use `db.[collection-name].find {"field":"value"}`. Use `it` iterate through the cursor which is a pointer to a result set of a query. A pointer is a direct address of the memory location.
