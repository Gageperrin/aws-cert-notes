# aws-cert-notes

These are my notes drafted in preparation for sitting various [AWS Certification exams](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/).

Exam dates:
* **Solutions Architect Associate C02** - August 12th, 2020. (No notes)
* **Solutions Architect Professional C01** - forthcoming

Planned:
* **Developer Associate**
* **SysOps Administrator Associate**
* **Database Specialty**

I used [Adrian Cantrill's courses](https://learn.cantrill.io/) and [TutorialDojo's practice exams](https://tutorialsdojo.com/) as my primary tools to prepare for both Solutions Architect exams.
