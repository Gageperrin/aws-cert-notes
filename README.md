# it-notes

These are my personal notes that I have drafted to (1) outline the conceptual and technical aspects of various IT technologies and (2) prepare for sitting various exams. They are taken from a variety of courses and documentation which are cited in each respective folder and file. These notes are purely for learning purposes and demonstration of knowledge. The holder(s) of the intellectual property rights to these courses may request for me to make the notes for their course content private if they so desire.
